/**
 * The public API for managing CP members and groups.
 *
 * Unlike dynamic nature of Hazelcast clusters, the CP subsystem requires
 * manual intervention while expanding / shrinking its size, or when
 * a CP member crashes or becomes unreachable. When a CP member becomes
 * unreachable, it cannot be automatically removed from the CP subsystem
 * because it could be still alive and partitioned away.
 * <p>
 * Moreover, the current CP subsystem implementation works only in memory
 * without persisting any state to disk. It means that a crashed CP member
 * will not be able to recover by reloading its previous state. Therefore,
 * crashed CP members create a danger for gradually losing majority of
 * CP groups and eventually total loss of availability of the CP subsystem.
 * To prevent such kind of situations, {@link CPSubsystemManagementService}
 * offers APIs for dynamic management of CP members.
 * <p>
 * The CP subsystem relies on Hazelcast's failure detectors to test
 * reachability of CP members. To be able to remove a CP member from
 * the CP subsystem, it must be declared as unreachable by Hazelcast's failure
 * detector, and removed from Hazelcast's member list.
 * <p>
 * CP member additions and removals are internally handled by performing
 * a single membership change at a time. When multiple CP members are shutting
 * down concurrently, their shutdown process is executed serially. First,
 * the Metadata CP group creates a membership change plan for CP groups. Then,
 * scheduled changes are applied to CP groups one by one. After all removals
 * are done, the shutting down CP member is removed the active CP members list
 * and its shutdown process is completed.
 * <p>
 * When a CP member is being shut down, it is replaced with another available
 * CP member in all of its CP groups, including the Metadata group, in order to
 * not to decrease or more importantly not to lose majority of CP groups.
 * If there is no available CP member to replace a shutting down CP member in a
 * CP group, that group's size will be reduced by 1 and its majority value will
 * be recalculated.
 * <p>
 * A new CP member can be added to the CP subsystem to either increase number
 * of available CP members for new CP groups or to fulfill missing slots in
 * existing CP groups. After the initial Hazelcast cluster startup is done,
 * an existing Hazelcast member can be be promoted to the CP member role.
 * This new CP member will automatically join to CP groups that has missing
 * members, and majority value of these CP groups will be recalculated.
 * <p>
 * A CP member may crash due to hardware problems or a defect in user code,
 * or it may become unreachable because of connection problems, such as network
 * partitions, network hardware failures, etc. If a CP member is known to be
 * alive but only has temporary communication issues, it will catch up the
 * other CP members and continue to operate normally after its communication
 * issues are resolved. If it is known to be crashed or communication issues
 * cannot be resolved in a short time, it can be preferable to remove this CP
 * member from the CP subsystem, hence from all its CP groups. In this case,
 * unreachable CP member should be terminated to prevent any accidental
 * communication with the rest of the CP subsystem.
 * <p>
 * When majority of a CP group is lost for any reason, that CP group cannot
 * make progress anymore. Even a new CP member cannot join to this CP group,
 * because member additions also go through the Raft consensus algorithm.
 * For this reason, the only option is to force-destroy the CP group via the
 * {@link #forceDestroyCPGroup(CPGroupId)} API. When this API is used, the CP
 * group is terminated non-gracefully, without the Raft algorithm mechanics.
 * Then, all CP data structure proxies that talk to this CP group fail with
 * {@link RaftGroupDestroyedException}. However, if a new proxy is created
 * afterwards, then this CP group will be re-created from scratch with a new
 * set of CP members. Losing majority of a CP group can be likened to
 * partition-loss scenario of AP Hazelcast.
 * <p>
 * Please note that CP groups that have lost their majority must be
 * force-destroyed immediately, because they can block the Metadata CP group
 * to perform membership changes.
 * <p>
 * Loss of majority of the Metadata CP group is the doomsday scenario for the
 * CP subsystem. It is a fatal failure and the only solution is to reset the
 * whole CP subsystem state via the {@link #resetAndInit()} API. To be able to
 * reset the CP subsystem, the initial size of the CP subsystem must be
 * satisfied, which is defined by {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getCPMemberCount()}.
 * For instance, {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getCPMemberCount()} is 5 and only 1
 * CP member is currently alive, {@link #resetAndInit()} must be called on this
 * CP member and 4 regular Hazelcast members. New Hazelcast members can be
 * started to satisfy {@link CPSubsystemConfig#getCPMemberCount()}.
